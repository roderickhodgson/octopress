[Illusory superiority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) is a phenomenon describing how people always overestimate their own abilities and positive qualities. Also called the above average effect (all drivers think they are at least above average drivers).

My blogging experience so far has always manifested itself through the following internal monologue:

1. What a keen observation I’m making. I should blog about that. Let’s load up the old blog.
2. Oh god, how embarassing. What a bloated, [overengineered mess](http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Database_Diagram).
3. I don’t even remember how this works. This such an overhead to manage. I just wanted to jot down a few notes! I know, I’ll try a new blogging engine/theme.
4. Hmmm, this new blog doesn’t look as good as the demos. Let me try and fiddle with it some more.
5. This is madness! I’ll roll out my own blogging platform when I have a moment. Let’s hold off publishing this article until then.
6. Repeat.

When it come to blogs, I suffer from what could perhaps best be described as illusory inferiority. A worse-than-average effect. My (perhaps irrational) crippling embarrassment of my blog’s superficial features has resulted in my writing a grand total of 1 and a half blog posts I care to share with the world. There are so many more as draft google docs, mindmaps, or scribbles in notepads that will likely never see the light of day. “Is Google mad for buying YouTube for $1.65 Billion?” Riveting stuff back in 2006, I assure you.

Now, as I write this, I am deep in step 4 of my latest blogging lifecycle. I’ve just finished installing [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "A blogging framework for hackers") and fiddling with it, trying to make it look interesting.

Only this time it’s different.

Now I may be wrong, but Wordpress has always manifested itself to me as this *monolithic* system. Whilst simple to install and use (hey, it “just works”), it is made of an underlying system of seemingly unbounded complexity, for which the effort of learning how it works far outweighs the benefits. Thus, the dissonance between the way it works and the way I *want it* to work is deafening. And so it sits there, sneering at my inability to improve on it.

Octopress is new to me in that is made up of many self-contained, documented, replaceable, interconnected pieces. Some of these I am already familiar with. By playing with it I’ve now stepped out of the cave. My blogging reality is no longer a mere illusion of posts rendered onto my browser in an apparent nondeterministic fashion. I have peered deep into the most fundamental reality of a blogging platform. I watch the cogs turn. I can take apart and rearrange the inner workings of the system without fear.

Then again, Octopress is not perfect. Rendering then uploading a static site rather than a dynamic one has implications both good and bad. But the difference is that I can easily fix anything I don’t like, *right down to the core*. And then even release it as an alternative solution, for others to use.

Now of course this prompts a moment of self-reflection. Why does abstracting away the internal working of a system like this leave me frustrated? Does lacking a mental model of the internals of a system cause me to feel an inferiority complex when using it? Is this characteristic a defining feature of the person I am today?

This might be too grand a generalisation. I observe that I am quite content to drive a car in ignorance of how much of the newer technology works. I’m sure it’s simple, but don’t ask me, for instance, how ABS works.

Is it not the case, then, that my discomfort is not the failure to understand a system, but a failure to understand a system when its internals are specifically of a nature that my skills and competency should understand it? That is, after all, a terrifying prospect to my ego.

In summary, next time I’m frustrated by a system hiding itself beneath a veneer of simplicity, I cannot blame the system. I’ll either bite the bullet and dig deeper, or find a replacement system that, by its very nature, opens itself up to me. 

(Also you should give Octopress a go. You won’t have to install a single thing on your remote server.)
